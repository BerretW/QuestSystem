# QuestSystem

Hi this is my second plugin, but the first with which I can show to the public :-D
This plugin can from regular tables make Quest table. Just to make the last line was the number of a quest that is,
proceed with and admin of with permission "appartus.creator" activates it with the right mouse button. The rest is done
on the config. The default config is created by first time run of plugin and includes two quests (1,2), which each one
is logically connected.

In Quest Requirements can be this tasks:
Level - Check if player have level above this value and remove value from his level
Item - Check if player have in primary hand requested item
Perm - Check if player have necessary permission
PermNot -  Check if player don't have selected permission

and as result of quest will be this:
Command - This run command as console. Command can have "@p" and plugin replace this with player name
Item - Give selected item as reward.

Plugin reload config with command "sponge plugins reload"
